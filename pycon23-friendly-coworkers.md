# Friendly Advocacy: How to share Python with your Co-workers

Track: Talks
Category: ??

## Description

For many Python enthusiasts, we choose Python because it *fits*â€”as a tool, it satisfies a particular set of needs we have. That doesn't mean that co-workers have caught on, though, or even that one's workplace is hospitable to using Python. This talk considers kind and playful ways, both rhetorical and technical, to introduce Python to co-workers (or friends and family members, for that matter). Your enthusiasm just might be contagious!

## Outline

Introduction (1 minute)

Poll (2 minutes)
- In your environment, is Python met with...
	* Adoption (others use Python)
	* Acceptance (you are at least allowed to use Python)
	* or Resistance?

Why I chose Python. Why did you? (5 minutes)
- the responsiveness of the REPL
- speed of development
- a kind community
- Extensive ecosystem, versatile
- Data-friendly
- Consider: what are *your* primary reasons for using Python?

Overcoming Resistance (5 minutes)
- Share your story (including why you find Python helpful) with co-workers and supervisors
- Find a need/niche where resistance is absent and Python is a good fit, then share your Python solution
- Construct some gentle arguments, then repeat them at an acceptable frequency
- Find Python libraries that are irresistible
- Consider pet projects that may be of interest to others

Promoting Adoption (5 minutes)
- Be other centered: this isn't about you, or even about Python, really. People respond well to empathy and generosity. ("Hey, here is a script I wrote. You might like it. Feel free to adapt it to your needs...")
- Make installation easy. Help Mac users use Homebrew, help Windows users use Scoop, Chocolatey, or Windows Store/winget.
- Ease into virtual environments. Begin, instead, with standalone scripts that only use the standard library.

The right tool for the right job (2 minutes)
- A tribal devotion to Python may not serve you or others well. Zealous dedication to a specific tool often betrays underconfidence or even incompetence with a varied landscape.
- Consider non-Python tools that others value; they will likely return the favor.

Discussion (5 minutes)

## Past experience

Currently a software engineer using SQL to convert data between systems, I have been a middle and high school teacher, software developer, IT director, data wrangler, and always a hobbyist developer. I feel comfortable in front of people. My co-workers don't use Python, either (yet).

I just presented at OLF (Ohio LinuxFest) on December 2, 2022, on using Python to manage Linux systems. Slides are available at olf22.bowmanjd.com and the video can be viewed on Youtube at https://youtu.be/DjOgRbHnvwU?t=465 (should start around 7 minutes, 45 seconds in).

A slide deck for a 2019 talk I gave at a local tech conference, introducing Python to IT professionals: bowmanjd.github.io/ttl/python-data/#1
