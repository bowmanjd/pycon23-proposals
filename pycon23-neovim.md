# Writing Python with Neovim

Track: Talks
Category: ??

## Description

Neovim is a lightweight, extensible, console-based editor that works well for writing Python (and many other languages). In this talk, we will explore if Neovim is a good fit for you, and consider options for configuring it well for Python development. Topics will include linters, formatters, syntax highlighting, tab-completion, and language servers. Discussion will primarily focus around sample configuration files that can be later adapted.
