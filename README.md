# Jonathan Bowman's PyCon US 2023 proposals

Here are three proposals I submitted for PyCon US 2023. I submitted 3 in the hopes that one would be a good fit for the conference.

# Invitation to review

I welcome feedback on any of these proposals; feel free to fork this repo and add comments, and/or create issues offering feedback or suggesting revisions.

Regards,
Jonathan
